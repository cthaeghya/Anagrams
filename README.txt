Build is as basic android application.

This is a basic implementation of a word list, where the color of the word is determined by its location in the original list.  Upon click, the list compresses to only the anagrams of the selected word.  The program allows the user to select a text file as possible dictionary/word list.  This should be formated so that each line is a single word.
